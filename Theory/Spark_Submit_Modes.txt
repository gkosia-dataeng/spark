Client:
        On client mode driver program run loccaly


        When to use:
            When you want interactive functionality (run code, see the results...)
            When develop/debug


Cluster:

        On cluster mode when submit a job to the cluster then the Cluster Manager (Master node) is used to find a slave node that have available resources to execute the Driver Program
        As a result the Driver program will run inside the cluster
        In this mode you cannot get the results, it must stored somewhere (table, file..)

        
        Proc:
            Easier resource allocation (master will decide where the driver program will run)
            Monitor the Driver Program from Master Web UI
            Stop at the end, once the job is finished the resources are freed
