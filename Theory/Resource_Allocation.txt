Problem:
    I have a file of 25GB size.
    I want to process it in paralellize

    How many cores i need?
    How many executors i need?
    What is the right memory per executor?
    What is the total memory?

Solution:

    File size  = 25GB
    Number of blocks:     file size  / default block size == 25GB / 128MB => 200 blocks
    Number of partitions: each block loaded as one partition              => 200 partitions 
    Number of cores:      each core run one task on one partition         => 200 cores

    Number of executors:  best practices said cores per executor should be 2-5, if we choose 4  => 200/4 => 50 

    Memory per core: minimum is 4 * default partition size => 4*128MB        => 512MB per core
    Memory per executor:  Memory per core * number of executors => 4 * 512MB => 2GB
    Total memory: Memory per executor * number of executors => 50 * 2GB      => 100GB
