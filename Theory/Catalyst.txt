Spark is sql engine
Dataframe logic will converted to Rdd program 
Catalyst optimizer is part of Spark SQL Engine
Catalyst optimizer will analyze the SQL or Dataframe program and will produce the RDD program

    1. User write the program in SQL or Datarame API 
    2. We have an unresolve logical plan
    3. Analyze the Unresolved logical plan and produce the logical Plan
    4. Optimize the Logical plan
            Predicate pushdown (move predicate earlier to have less data)
            Projection Pruning (only the columns needed will be read and prossed)
            Join reordering: most efficient join order based on the size of tables
    5. Produce multiple physical plans and assign a cost 
    6. Choose the lower cost physical plan and generate the RDD code
