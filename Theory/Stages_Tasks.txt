When we submit an app then two processes will start

    Driver programm: master process: 8088
    Executor program: slave process: 7077

    When i am runnign in cluster mode:

        1. Resource manager will instuct Node Managers to allocate resources for the executors
        2. For each block will be created a partition (block is in storage, partition is im memory)
        3. The Driver will send the driver program to all nodes (the executors)


Task: it is the execution of an operation on a single partition
      after the execution of the task the data will be saved to a new partition and the previous partition will discurted
      1 core run 1 task that can operate on a single partition
      #blocks = #partitions = #tasks 

Stage: each narrow transformation run in a task and produce a new partition
       each wide transformation triggers a shuffle(data exchange between partitions) and a new stage is initiated

        A task is the execution of a narrow transformation on a partition
        A stage is a sequence of narrow transformations
        New stage: will be created on each wide transformation
