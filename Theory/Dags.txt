Sprk is Lazy evaluation engine
Will trigger execution only when an action operation should run
At that point the operations until that point will be included to produce the execution plan

Dag: logical flow of operations, its based on the physical plan rdd program 
      chain of rdd dependencies organized as Dag
      Nodes are the rdds, Edges are the operations

      
The DAG is needed for:
    Optimized plans
    Minimize shuffle: 
    Fault tolerance: 
    RDD recovery
